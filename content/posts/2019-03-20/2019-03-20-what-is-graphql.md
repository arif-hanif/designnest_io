> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

In simple terms GraphQL is a **syntax that describes how to ask for data**, and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. GraphQL has three main characteristics:

- It lets the client specify exactly what data it needs.
- It makes it easier to aggregate data from multiple sources.
- It uses a type system to describe data.

With GraphQL, the user is able to make a single call to fetch the required information rather than to construct several REST requests to fetch the same.

A GraphQL query is a string that is sent to a server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client.
