First of all, welcome to the designnest.io blog, dedicated to everything I am learning as a software engineer. Some specific technologies and software I will be sharing about Django, React, Graphql, Autodesk FORGE Services, Kubernetes, Docker, and much more.

## What am I going to do with this?

In this blog, I will talk about information technology in the AEC industry.

## Who is going to read this?

This blog aims to be accessible by anyone from the building industry, BIM expert or not. I will try my best to break down complex topics into multiple blogs so the information is easier to consume.

## Why am I doing this?

I enjoy sharing what I am learning. Hope you all get something out of it.

## Who am I doing this for?

For myself, and for anyone interested in Building Information Modeling and related subjects.

## How often am I going to be posting and adding information?

I’ll try to write post on a weekly basis, but don’t expect to much of me…

If you have any suggestions for interesting topics to cover, as well as any remark about the blog itself, feel free to post a comment.
